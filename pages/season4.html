        <h3>Attack on Titan The Final Season Soundtrack</h3>
        <p>As the final season of the anime, this is the only soundtrack to have released without a number attached to it; it's just known as the final season. Interestingly, the final season is split into two parts so it's predicted that there will be another soundtrack release, despite this one being named the final season's soundtrack. Until the second half of the season is released, this is the only soundtrack to have only one part or disc.
        </p>

        <p>Released on 23rd June 2021, this is also the first season which was only co-composed by the usual Hiroyuki Sawano; instead KOHTA YAMAMOTO is the lead composter.
